# yubitoggle

Use xinput to toggle a yubikey on and off.

## Getting started

- Clone this repo
- Install `xinput` through your package manager.
- Put `yubitoggle` somewhere on path. It doesn't require any special privileges.
- Run `yubitoggle` If all goes well, your yubikey will be enabled / disabled.
- You can run `DEBUG=1 yubitoggle` to get some basic debugging info.

## Known issues

- This only works for a single yubikey.
